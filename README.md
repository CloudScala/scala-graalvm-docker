# scala-graalvm-docker

This project provides a collection of docker images to facilitate the usage of GraalVM by Scala projects, guaranteeing a consistent and reproducible environment where native images can be produced in an automated fashion.

> "Make development more productive and run programs faster anywhere." - GraalVM


## Goal

Accelerate GraalVM's adoption during develop, test, and release phases of Scala projects.


## Available

Scala: 2.11.8 and 2.12.6

SBT: From 0.13.15 until 1.1.5

GraalVM: 1.0.0-RC1

List of tags: [cloudscala/scala-graalvm:{tags}](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudscala/scala-graalvm/tags/)


## How to use


Automating the development, testing, and release process will vary based on the needs of a project, but the following example could fit all cases. This repo contains a `docker-compose-example.yml` as an example of how to use an image.


```docker-compose
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    image: cloudscala/scala-graalvm:scala-2.12.6-sbt-1.1.5-graalvm-1.0.0-rc1
    command: ./generate-native-image-example.sh
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - ~/.ivy2:/root/.ivy2
      - ~/.sbt:/root/.sbt
      - ~/.coursier:/root/.coursier 
```


By opening the console and running `docker-compose run app`; the docker-compose file must be in the project's root level, docker-compose will pull the version `scala-2.12.6-sbt-1.1.5-graalvm-1.0.0-rc1` and we execute the `./generate-native-image-example.sh` when the container boots up. Also, notice that the we share the current directory and known artifact folders with the container to avoid having the container's SBT loading all artificats everytime.


The `generate-native-image-example.sh`:

```shell
# Set distribution folder from first argument, otherwise default to `native`
NATIVE_IMAGE_FOLDER=native-image
if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
	NATIVE_IMAGE_FOLDER=$1
fi

# Create native-image folder if it doesn't exist, and clear the contents
mkdir -p ${NATIVE_IMAGE_FOLDER}
rm -rf ${NATIVE_IMAGE_FOLDER}/*

# Create an .jar using sbt-assembly
sbt -mem 2048 clean assembly

# Move .jar to native-image folder
find "." -name '*.jar' | while read APP_JAR; do
	mv $APP_JAR $NATIVE_IMAGE_FOLDER
done

# Go to native-image folder and generate the executables for each .jar
cd $NATIVE_IMAGE_FOLDER

find "." -name '*.jar' | while read APP_JAR; do
	echo "Processing .jar '$APP_JAR' on $NATIVE_IMAGE_FOLDER folder"
	native-image -J-Xmx2G -J-Xms2G --no-server -H:+ReportUnsupportedElementsAtRuntime -jar ${APP_JAR}
done
```


Creates a `native-image` folder in the project folder, triggers SBT's task `sbt assembly`, moves the created `.jar` to `native-image` folder, and at last but not least, generates the native image using GRAALVM `native-image` command.


Once the executable is ready in the `native-image` folder, we can run it inside the very same container, by changing the `command` in the `docker-compose` to point to `./native-image/{GENERATED-EXECUTABLE-FILE}`, or ship it to S3, or create a new docker image and publish to AWS ECR, etc... what to do with the executable is matter of creativity.


Note that we presume that the current Scala project is using [sbt-assembly](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly) plugin, but any other plugin could be used, like [sbt-pack](https://github.com/xerial/sbt-pack), [sbt-native-packager](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/), [sbt-onejar](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-onejar), and [sbt-proguard](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-proguard).


## Spark Job example


The folder `spark-job-graalvm-example` contains an example where it uses the docker-compose and shell above.
